         <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Strategic planning is an organization's process of defining its strategy, or direction, and making decisions on allocating its resources to pursue this strategy.
            It is executed by strategic planners or strategists, who involve many parties and research sources in their analysis of the organization and its relationship to the environment in which it competes.[1]
            Strategy has many definitions, but generally involves setting strategic goals, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions. A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources). The senior leadership of an organization is generally tasked with determining strategy. Strategy can be planned (intended) or can be observed as a pattern of activity (emergent) as the organization adapts to its environment or competes.
            strategy formation itself involves synthesis (i.e., "connecting the dots") via strategic thinking. As such, strategic planning occurs around the strategy formation activity.

            Make sure you have a safety net. Holding some money in reserve is a good idea because (a) if you lose your investment you'll have something to fall back on, and (b) it will allow you to be a bolder investor, since you won't be worried about risking every penny you own.
            . Call it your emergency fund, set aside for large, unexpected expenses (job loss, medical expenses, auto accident, etc.). This money should be in cash or some other form that's very conservative and immediately available.
            Once you have an emergency fund established, you can start to save for your long-term goals, like buying a home, retirement, and college tuition.
            If your employer offers a retirement plan, this is a great vehicle for saving, because it can save on your tax bill, and your employer may contribute money to match some of your own contributions, which amounts to "free" money for you.
           . If you are self-employed, you have options like a SEP-IRA or a "SIMPLE" IRA. Once you've determined the type of account(s) to set up, you can then choose specific

    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> It is without a doubt the term organic has eluded to more than just one meaning. The perceived notion that anything not organically grown is unhealthy, is completely false. For many people, deciding on whether or not to purchase organic produce comes down to cost, availability, health, and ethical beliefs. In today’s times, the health benefits of eating organic vs non-organic is still inconclusive and cannot dictate a person’s overall health. The big picture of food safety is that at any major grocery store, almost all products be it boxed, frozen, canned, or fresh will have traces of chemicals that could potentially cause harm, but usually don't unless consumed in large quantities. With that being said, it is more than okay to buy regular produce if that is what fits the budget and keeps fruits and vegetables in the diet.
       .Some may apply sustainable and extra mile practices, while others simply meet the minimum standards to be considered USDA organic. In areas with food deserts, produce boxes such as imperfect produce may be a
